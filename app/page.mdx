# Welcome to my MDX page!

This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

Include, should be hidden:

```twoslash include main
export const hello = { str: "world" };
```

Twoslashed, should be shown, with the content above injected:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main

hello.
//    ^|
```
